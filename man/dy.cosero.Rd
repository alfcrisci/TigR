\title{Plot results regarding runoff from COSERO using dygraphs}
\usage{
dy.cosero(
  qoutput = NULL,
  read.data = TRUE,
  prec = FALSE,
  wb = FALSE,
  comp = FALSE,
  eta = FALSE,
  storage = FALSE,
  snowmelt = FALSE,
  group = NULL,
  area = NULL,
  height = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{qoutput}{Either a path to the file to be read or the result from \link{readCosero}}

\item{read.data}{logical. If TRUE, qoutput will be read in using \link{readCosero}}

\item{prec}{logical or character string. Should precipitation data be read in? Maybe a path to the corresponding file.}

\item{wb}{logical. If TRUE cumsums of waterbalance components are calculated and plotted. Note that if wb == TRUE, area must be given!}

\item{comp}{logical or character string. Should data about the composition of runoff be read in? Maybe a path to the corresponding file.}

\item{eta}{logical or character string. Should data about evapotranspiration be read in? Maybe a path to the corresponding file.}

\item{storage}{logical or character string. Should storage data be read in? Maybe a path to the corresponding file.}

\item{snowmelt}{logical or character string. Should snow data be read in? Maybe a path to the corresponding file.}

\item{group}{character string or NULL. Used to group dygraph plots. See \link{dygraph}}

\item{height}{numeric, "auto", or NULL. Height in pixels (optional, defaults to automatic sizing). If "auto" a total plot of 1200px is assumed and devided by the amount of plots.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed on either to \link{readCosero} or to \link{dygraph}}
}
\value{
Nothing is returned to R. Only the dygraphs are plotted.
}
\description{
Plot the results regarding runoff from COSERO using dygraphs. The output may be grouped together with other results.
}
\details{
If read,data == FALSE the results from \code{\link{readCosero}} must be passed on to \code{dy.cosero}.
    In this case the parameters \code{prec},\code{comp},\code{storage},\code{snowmelt}, and \code{eta} may be logical
    
    Note that at this time, this function only works for basins with only one subbasin!
